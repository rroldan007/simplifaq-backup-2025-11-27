Simplifaq – Swiss Invoicing SaaS
Product Specification & Functional Description
1. Product Purpose

Simplifaq is a SaaS invoicing application built exclusively for the Swiss market.
Its purpose is to allow independent professionals and small businesses to create, manage, send, and track invoices in full compliance with Swiss fiscal regulations, while remaining simple, fast, and accessible to non-accountants.

The product focuses on:

Legal compliance (TVA, Swiss QR Bills)

Ease of use (clean UI, minimal steps)

SaaS-level visibility (metrics, dashboards, usage tracking)

Scalability (subscriptions, Stripe integration)

Simplifaq is not a full accounting suite. It is an invoicing-first SaaS, designed to evolve.

4. Admin Panel (Critical Requirement)

Needs to be rebuilt properly

Currently connected (yes/no)

Deactivate / reactivate users

SaaS Usage Metrics

4.3 Admin Invoicing (Mandatory)

The admin must be able to:

Generate invoices to Simplifaq subscribers

Invoice subscriptions manually if needed

Issue invoices outside Stripe (fallback)

Keep invoices compliant with Swiss rules

This is non-negotiable.

5. Stripe Integration
5.1 Subscription Management

Stripe as payment provider

Monthly subscriptions

Plans synced with Simplifaq database

Webhooks used (no polling)

Tracked per user:

Stripe customer ID

Subscription status

Simplifaq:

Controls feature access

Allows admin invoicing if Stripe fails or is bypassed

6. Technical Stack (Required)

TypeScript

Vite

Tailwind CSS

React Router

Zustand (state)

React Hook Form

Axios

Backend

Node.js

Express.js

TypeScript

PostgreSQL

Prisma ORM

JWT authentication

bcrypt password hashing

Billing & Compliance

Stripe (subscriptions & payments)

swissqrbill (QR Bill generation)

7. How the System Should Work (Flow Summary)

User signs up

User subscribes via Stripe

Subscription activates account

User creates clients and invoices

System generates compliant Swiss invoice + QR Bill

Invoice sent as PDF

TVA automatically tracked

Admin monitors usage, users, subscriptions

Admin can invoice users directly if needed

8. Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

Full accounting

Payroll

Tax filing submission

International invoicing rules (non-Swiss)

9. Key Constraints

No mock data

No hardcoded logic

Everything connected to real database

Production-grade admin panel

Swiss compliance is mandatory

10. Summary

Simplifaq is a Swiss-first invoicing SaaS:

Simple for users

Strict on compliance

Serious on SaaS metrics

Designed to scale

If the admin panel or Stripe integration is weak, the product fails as a SaaS.
